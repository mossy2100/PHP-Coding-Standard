## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Renamed package** from `galaxon/coding-standard` to `oceanmoon/coding-standard` — update your `composer.json` require accordingly.
- **Renamed sniffs** — all `Galaxon.*` sniff references must be updated to `OceanMoon.*` in `phpcs.xml` and any inline `// phpcs:ignore` comments:
  - `Galaxon.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration` → `OceanMoon.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration`
  - `Galaxon.Classes.ClassInstantiationNoBrackets` → `OceanMoon.Classes.ClassInstantiationNoBrackets`
  - `Galaxon.Classes.PropertyDeclaration` → `OceanMoon.Classes.PropertyDeclaration`
  - `Galaxon.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent` → `OceanMoon.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent`
- **Renamed PHP namespaces** from `Galaxon\*` to `OceanMoon\*` throughout all source and test files.
- **Moved source tree** from `src/Galaxon/` to `src/OceanMoon/`.
- **Ruleset name** changed from `Galaxon` to `OceanMoon` — update `<rule ref="Galaxon"/>` to `<rule ref="OceanMoon"/>` in your `phpcs.xml`.
- `composer.json`: updated author email, homepage, and support URLs to Ocean Moon Software.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Removed `SlevomatCodingStandard.Commenting.RequireOneLineDocComment` from the ruleset. The sniff was too aggressive in collapsing multi-line docblocks that callers preferred to keep expanded.

### Fixed

- **ClassInstantiationNoBracketsSniff** — No longer incorrectly removes parentheses from method/function call argument lists containing `new` expressions (e.g. `$obj->add(new Foo())->method()`).

### Documentation

- README: removed `RequireOneLineDocComment` from the sniff list; minor wording fix.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- **Single-line arrays take priority** — any list (without nested arrays) that fits on one line without overflowing the maximum line length and without multiline elements now uses single-line format, regardless of content. Function calls and `new` expressions no longer force multiline when the array fits on one line. Lists with nested arrays always use one-per-line format.
- **Nested arrays excluded from grid format** — lists containing nested arrays that are too long for a single line use one-per-line format instead of grid.
- **UseSpacing** — set `linesCountBetweenUseTypes` to 1 for a blank line between different import types (class, function, const).
- Excluded `Generic.Files.LineLength.TooLong` warning (replaced by Slevomat's `Files.LineLength.LineTooLong` error).
- Removed `UselessConstantTypeHint` sniff (not needed with `ClassConstantTypeHint`).

### Fixed

- **Array fix bouncing** — fixed infinite loop in PHPCBF when collapsing a multiline list to single line. The trailing comma removal and single-line collapse no longer conflict.

### Documentation

- Updated README to reflect single-line priority for all list types.
- Updated array formatting examples and descriptions.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Grid format eligibility expanded** — variables, properties, constants, enums, and simple expressions (e.g. grouping parentheses) are now eligible for single-line and grid formatting, not just scalar literals.
- **Function/method calls, `new` expressions, and closures always one-per-line** — arrays containing these elements are formatted one item per line regardless of total length.
- Updated README to reflect new grid eligibility rules and terminology.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Grid format** for scalar list arrays too long for a single line — items arranged in uniformly padded rows.
- **One-per-line format** for non-scalar list arrays — function calls, expressions, etc. always formatted one element per line with trailing comma, regardless of length.
- **Unit tests** for all four custom Galaxon sniffs:
  - `Galaxon.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration` — covers scalar lists, grid format, one-per-line, list-of-arrays, associative arrays, mixed keyed/unkeyed, and explicit sequential integer keys.
  - `Galaxon.Classes.ClassInstantiationNoBrackets` — covers method calls, property access, nullsafe, constructor args, chained calls.
  - `Galaxon.Classes.PropertyDeclaration` — covers hooks, asymmetric visibility, modifier ordering, var keyword, underscore warning.
  - `Galaxon.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent` — covers PHP 8.4 property hook indentation.
- PHPUnit configuration (`phpunit.xml.dist`) and test bootstrap.

### Changed

- `Galaxon.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration` sniff rewritten with format-selection logic: scalar lists use single-line or grid; non-scalar lists and associative arrays use one-per-line.
- README updated with documentation for all array formats, links to upstream standard documentation (PSR-12, Generic, Squiz, Slevomat), and improved descriptions.

### Fixed

- `Galaxon.Classes.ClassInstantiationNoBrackets` namespace corrected from `dev\Sniffs\Classes` to `Galaxon\Sniffs\Classes`.
- Trailing whitespace in `Core\Stringify::stringifyList()` grid format — last item on each row no longer padded.

### Removed

- Old manual test fixtures in `tests/` directory (replaced by proper PHPUnit-based unit tests in `src/Galaxon/Tests/`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- Custom `Galaxon.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration` sniff for consistent array formatting:
  - Simple list arrays: single line if possible, no trailing comma
  - List of arrays: one element per line, trailing comma required
  - Associative arrays: one key-value pair per line, arrows aligned, trailing comma required
- Proper Unicode support using `mb_strlen()` for accurate arrow alignment with multibyte characters
